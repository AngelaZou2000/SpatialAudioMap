# SpatialAudioMap
This is the codebase for the Spatial AudioMap project by Angela Zou, Robby Huang, and Kathleen Wang. Our project is a spatial audio map of Ithaca Collegetown that allows the user to use a joystick to virtually travel around the Collegetown crossing area and hear surrounding, directional sound.
